  Modules                      Contains the Delphi\Delphi.dpr  project that creates the Modules\Delphi.pyd Python module
                               that allows you to interact with Delphi VCL objects from Python.

INSTALLATION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Install the Python for Windows distribution (http://www.python.org/).
  In case your Python distribution does not register an environment variable
  PYTHONHOME, (for example Anaconda) see under NOTES.

  1) Install the core components
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  For recent versions of Delphi, install the "Python_d" package located in the 
  Components folder and add the folder "...\Components\Sources\Core".

  For Delphi 3, install the "Python_d3" package located in the Components folder
  and add the folder "...\Components\Sources\Core".

  For Delphi 4, install the "Python_d4" package located in the Components folder
  and add the folder "...\Components\Sources\Core".

  For Delphi 5, install the "Python_d5" package located in the Components folder
  and add the folder "...\Components\Sources\Core".

  For Delphi 6, install the "Python_d6" package located in the Components folder
  and add the folder "...\Components\Sources\Core".

  For Delphi 7, install the "Python_d7" package located in the Components folder
  and add the folder "...\Components\Sources\Core".

  2) Install the VCL components (this is optional)
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  For recent versions of Delphi, install the "PythonVCL_d" package located in the 
  Components folder and add the folder "...\Components\Sources\Core".

  For Delphi 3, install the "PythonVCL_d3" package located in the Components folder
  and add the folder "...\Components\Sources\VCL".

  For Delphi 4, install the "PythonVCL_d4" package located in the Components folder
  and add the folder "...\Components\Sources\VCL".

  For Delphi 5, install the "PythonVCL_d5" package located in the Components folder
  and add the folder "...\Components\Sources\VCL".

  For Delphi 6, install the "PythonVCL_d6" package located in the Components folder
  and add the folder "...\Components\Sources\VCL".

  For Delphi 7, install the "PythonVCL_d7" package located in the Components folder
  and add the folder "...\Components\Sources\VCL".


  3) Build Modules\Delphi\Delphi.dpr (This is optional and unsupported)
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Once the project is build you can either extend the Python path with ..\Modules or
  copy ..Modules\Delphi.pyd to C:\Python24\DLLs, to be able to import the Delphi module
  from Python.

  Note that you can try this module by invoking the ..\Modules\TestApp.py script.

NOTES:
~~~~~
  1) Don't forget to look at the tutorial file (tutorial.txt) which introduces the
     demos.
  
  2) In case your Python distribution does not register (set) the environment variable
     PYTHONHOME, you need to either
     - add that variable yourself and let it point to the folder with your python dll
     or
     - add some code to obtain a valid TPythonVersion and assign that to your
       (T)PythonEngine before it loads the python dll.

DISTRIBUTION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  You are free to distribute your applications built with Python for Delphi,
  but don't forget to install the python15.dll in the window\system folder of
  your client, or install the Python for windows distribution (it needs more
  space on the harddisk, but it's better because there are all Python modules
  and the help).
