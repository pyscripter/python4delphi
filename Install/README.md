## P4D Installation using [MultiInstaller](https://github.com/pyscripter/MultiInstaller)

Use for Delphi Seattle (10.4) or later to install all packages in one step. 

1. Clone or copy the Python4Delphi git repository to a folder of your choice.  **The setup.ini file assumes that the folder is called "P4D"**.  If you chose to name your folder differently then modify the "Folder" option in setup.ini.
2. Close all Delphi IDEs running.
3. Run MultiInstaller.exe
4. Select the packages you want and press Next
5. In the dialog box specify the _**parent folder**_ of "P4D" (i.e. the folder containing the directory to which you have copied Python4Delphi) and the Delphi target version.  Then press Next to install the components
