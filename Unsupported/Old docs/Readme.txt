  Lib                          Library of Python modules.
  PythonIDE                    A Python developpment environment written in Delphi.
                               See PythonIDE\Readme.txt for the required components.
  Modules                      Contains the Delphi\Delphi.dpr  project that creates the Modules\Delphi.pyd Python module
                               that allows you to interact with Delphi VCL objects from Python.

INSTALLATION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  install the Python for Windows distribution (http://www.python.org/).

  1) Install the core components
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  For recent versions of Delphi, install the "Python_d" package located in the 
  Components folder and add the folder "...\Components\Sources\Core" to the library
  path.

  
  2) Install the VCL components (this is optional)
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  For recent versions of Delphi, install the "PythonVCL_d" package located in the 
  Components folder and add the folder "...\Components\Sources\Core" to the library
  path.


  3) Build Modules\Delphi\Delphi.dpr (This is optional and unsupported)
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Once the project is build you can either extend the Python path with ..\Modules or
  copy ..Modules\Delphi.pyd to C:\Python24\DLLs, to be able to import the Delphi module
  from Python.

  Note that you can try this module by invoking the ..\Modules\TestApp.py script.

NOTE:
~~~~~
  Don't forget to look at the tutorial file (tutorial.txt) which introduces the
  demos.

DISTRIBUTION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  You are free to distribute your applications built with Python for Delphi,
  but don't forget to install the Python for windows distribution.
